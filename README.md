This repository contains an analysis of the second-handed car market in France. The data has been scrapped from https://www.autoscout24.fr/ and then cleaned, encoded, processed and analysed in the python notebook. <br>
This project shows the use of the <br>pandas </br>and <br>seaborn</br> libraries, and application of <br>regex and linear regression.</br>
